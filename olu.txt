First Task :

Write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point,, character by character to determine:

The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
The number of vowels in the sentence.
You have to keep in mind that:

Each character will be treated separately.

The last character is the point.

Use three variables as counters.

ANSWER :

 PROBLEM : 
	* words count
	* vowel count
 SOLUTION :
	* Create variable to hold sentence, word count, vowel char.
	* Read the sentence,
	* Getting to a space add 1 to word count,
	* Continue counting until getting to point,
	* Read vowel char ( a,e,i,o,u),
	* Read sentence char by char,
	* If sentence char match any vowel char add 1 to vowel count.



Second Task:
Description:

Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set. In other words, 
find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the given set.

Example:
Set 1 : [3, 1, 7, 9], Set 2: [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2 )
Use an array as a method.
Initialize sum = 0. Compare each element of set one with the second set and if element is not present then add that element to sum.
 Then do the vice versa to add elements from the second set.

ANSWER :
 	* Create variable for set 1 and set 2,
	* Create variable for storing the sum,
	* Read the set and check if the read set 1 element,
	* Check if set 1 element is not present in set 2,
	* If true add the element of set 1 to your sum,
	* Read set 2,
	* Check if element in set 2 is not in set 1,
	* If true add the element to sum,
	* Print Sum.
